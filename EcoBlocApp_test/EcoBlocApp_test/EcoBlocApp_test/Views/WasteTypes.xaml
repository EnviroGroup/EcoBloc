                    Knowing how to identify types of waste in your environment is important because waste should be handled differently and some waste can be very harmful to humans and the environment, i.e hazardous waste. Waste can cause air and water pollution if disposed incorrectly. Rotting garbage is also known to produce harmful gases that mix with the air and can cause breathing problems in people. Since modern humans produce large amounts of waste, most of the waste generated is not biodegradable.
