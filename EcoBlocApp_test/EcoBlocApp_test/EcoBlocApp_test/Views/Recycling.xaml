Recycling is one of the best ways for you to have a positive impact both on us and the world in which we live. With recycling, a substantial portion of our waste can be broken down into their original elements and be used to produce new materials.

Some material i.e plastic bags and containers, some of the construction waste like excess planks and cupboard, if still in a good condition, can be re-used in household. Reusing material is very cost effective and creating something from the material can serve as a great pass-time.
